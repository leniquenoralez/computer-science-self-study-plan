> “Plan Your Work And Work Your Plan.” - Napoleon Hill

My personal guide to learning fundamental and advanced Computer Science subjects. The purpose of this plan is to create a solid foundation as a Software Engineer. This repo only includes computer science learning material. It previously contained materials to help with job interview preparation but I removed all them.

The best way to improve as a software developer is to work on projects. You can view [this repo](https://github.com/leniquenoralez/awsome-software-development-projects) that I'll be updating with great project ideas to apply your skills to improve as a developer.
